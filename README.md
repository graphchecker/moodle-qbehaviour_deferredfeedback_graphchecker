This is a copy of Moodle's built-in deferred feedback question behavior, modified so that it can be used with [GraphChecker](https://github.com/graphchecker/moodle-qtype_graphchecker). You will need to install this plugin before installing GraphChecker.

When GraphChecker encounters a question asking for the deferred feedback behavior, it will automatically use this plugin instead.
